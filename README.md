## OT Security Lab
This project is a modular Operational Technology (OT) lab designed to simulate industrial networks and protocols for cybersecurity testing.

In the future, this lab will allow testing and validation of attack simulations, detection strategies, and monitoring techniques for OT systems, in a safe and fully isolated environment. It will serve as a platform to experiment with industrial protocols, network segmentation, and security controls, following standard OT best practices.
