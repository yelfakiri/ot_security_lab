## OT Security Lab

This project is a modular Operational Technology (OT) security lab designed to simulate realistic industrial networks and protocols for cybersecurity testing.

The lab focuses on OT-specific constraints and best practices, including network segmentation, controlled inter-zone communications, and alignment with the Purdue Model and IEC 62443 principles.

### Project Status

- Phase 1 – Technical Infrastructure: Completed
- Segmented OT and Industrial DMZ networks
- Dedicated inter-zone router/firewall
- Default deny policy between zones

The environment now provides a solid foundation for upcoming phases involving attack simulation, network-based detection, and SOC-oriented monitoring.
